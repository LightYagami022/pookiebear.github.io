        <p>Hi Pookie Bear!</p>
        <p>How have you been lately? I'd love to hear about what you've been up to and how life's treating you these days. I know you've been really active with your church activities and work there. How's that been going? Any new experiences or events that you've been part of?</p>
        <p>More importantly, how are you feeling? I hope you're doing well both physically and mentally. It can be tough to juggle everything, so I wanted to check in and see if you need any support or just someone to talk to. Remember, I'm always here for you.</p>
        <p>Let's catch up soon! I will bring you coffee on the 18th!</p>
